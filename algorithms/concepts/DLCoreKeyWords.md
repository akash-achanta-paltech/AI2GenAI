**Core Keywords in Deep Learning:**

*   **Weights:**
    *   **Concept:** Numerical values associated with the connections between neurons. They represent the "strength" or "importance" of each input signal as it passes through the network. The network learns by continuously adjusting these weights during training.
    *   **Analogy:** Think of them as volume knobs on an audio mixer â€“ they control how much of each input signal contributes to the next sound (output).

*   **Biases:**
    *   **Concept:** An additional numerical value added to the weighted sum of inputs for each neuron. It allows the neuron to activate even if all its inputs are zero, or it shifts the activation function's output. It's like a baseline or a threshold.
    *   **Analogy:** A baseline setting on that same audio mixer, allowing you to set a minimum output level regardless of input volumes.
*   **Loss Function (or Cost Function / Error Function):**
    *   **Concept:** A mathematical function that quantifies how well (or poorly) a model is performing. It measures the discrepancy between the model's predicted output and the actual true output. The goal of training is always to *minimize* this loss.
    *   **Analogy:** A "scorecard" where a lower score means the model is performing better. For a dartboard, the loss would be the distance from the bullseye.
*   **Gradient:**
    *   **Concept:** In the context of deep learning, the gradient is a vector that indicates the direction of the steepest *increase* of the loss function with respect to the weights and biases.
    *   **Analogy:** If the loss function is a landscape, the gradient at a point tells you the direction a ball would roll *uphill* most steeply. To minimize loss, we want to go in the *opposite* direction.

*   **Gradient Descent:**
    *   **Concept:** An iterative optimization algorithm used to find the minimum of a function (our loss function). It adjusts the model's parameters (weights and biases) in small steps, moving in the direction *opposite* to the gradient of the loss function. This gradually leads the model towards a state where its predictions are most accurate.
    *   **Analogy:** Imagine a blindfolded person trying to find the lowest point in a valley. They take small steps, always feeling which direction is downhill, and moving in that direction.

    *   **Visual Explanation:**

*   **Backpropagation:**
    *   **Concept:** The core algorithm that efficiently calculates the gradients of the loss function with respect to all the weights and biases in the neural network. It works by propagating the error (the difference between predicted and actual output) backward from the output layer through the hidden layers, effectively distributing responsibility for the error across the network.
    *   **Analogy:** If you have an error in a complex calculation, backpropagation is like tracing backward through all the steps to figure out exactly which numbers contributed how much to that error, so you know how to adjust them.
